# Titanic Survival Analysis with R

## Project Description

This repository contains the code and data for a machine learning analysis of the famous Titanic dataset. The primary goal is to build a predictive model that determines a passenger's likelihood of survival based on their personal and travel-related features.

This project was developed as an entry for the [Kaggle "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) competition. The entire workflow, from data cleaning to modeling, was performed using the **R** programming language.

## Files in this Repository

* `titanic.R`: The main R script that contains the entire process: data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and prediction file generation.
* `titanic.pdf`: A detailed report documenting the exploratory data analysis, the rationale behind key decisions, and the evaluation of variable importance.
* `train.csv`: The training dataset provided by Kaggle. It contains passenger features and the target variable (`Survived`).
* `test.csv`: The test dataset provided by Kaggle. It contains the same features as the training set but without the `Survived` variable.
* `submission_titanic_ranger.csv`: The output file generated by the `titanic.R` script, formatted for submission to the Kaggle competition.

## Methodology

The approach taken in this project can be summarized in the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Combination**: The `train.csv` and `test.csv` datasets are loaded and combined to ensure consistent data processing across both sets.
2.  **Data Cleaning (Imputation)**:
    * Missing values in the `Age` variable were imputed using the median.
    * Missing values in the `Fare` variable were imputed using the median.
    * Missing values in the `Embarked` variable were imputed using the mode (the most frequent port).
3.  **Feature Engineering**:
    * **`Title`**: A passenger's title (e.g., Mr, Mrs, Miss) was extracted from the `Name` column.
    * **`FamilySize`**: A new feature was created by summing the `SibSp` (siblings/spouses) and `Parch` (parents/children) columns, plus one (for the passenger themselves).
4.  **Modeling**:
    * A **Random Forest** algorithm was used for the predictive model.
    * The implementation was done using the `ranger` package in R, which is a faster and more memory-efficient alternative to the traditional `randomForest` package.
5.  **Prediction**: The trained model was used to predict survival outcomes on the test dataset and generate the final submission file.

According to the variable importance analysis (documented in `titanic.pdf`), the most influential features for predicting survival were, in order: **`Title`, `Fare`, `Sex`, and `Pclass`**.

## How to Run the Code

To replicate this analysis and generate the prediction file, follow these steps:

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have **R** and, preferably, **RStudio** installed on your system.

### 2. Clone the Repository

### 3. Install Libraries
Open an R session (or RStudio) and run the following commands in the console to install the necessary libraries:

install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ranger")

### 4. Run the Script
Open the titanic.R file in RStudio. Make sure the train.csv and test.csv files are in the same working directory. Then, run the entire script.
